#Joomdlebs theme#

Joomdlebs is a theme for moodle 2.5 and based in the Boostrap theme created by Bas Brands.

It is intended to use with Joomdle, the amazing Joomla moodle integration extension, because some features are removed like the login.

You can change the basic colors from the backend: site background, links, links hover and menu backgrond.



Joomdlebs is licensed under a GPL (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) .

Feel free to use it as a base for your themes. Copy the files to another folder and rename them to start your own theme.
